# Amazon Bedrock Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to give you hands-on experience leveraging foundation models (FMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Amazon Bedrock. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides access to FMs from third-party providers and Amazon; available via an API. With Bedrock, you can choose from a variety of models to find the one that’s best suited for your use case.

Within this series of labs, you will be taken through some of the most common RAG usage patterns we are seeing with our customers for Generative AI. We will explore RAG techniques for generating text, creating value for organizations by improving productivity. This is achieved by leveraging foundation models to help in retrieving and searching documents. You will gain hands-on experience using Bedrock APIs, SDKs, and open-source software for example LangChain and FAISS to implement these usage patterns.

This workshop is intended for developers and solution builders.
